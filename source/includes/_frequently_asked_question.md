- **Why do I need to connect to a node?**
  
  The Ontology protocol defines a way for people to interact with smart contracts and each other over a network. In order to have up-to-date information about the status of contracts, balances, and new transactions, the protocol requires a connection to nodes on the network. These nodes are constantly sharing new data with each other. The SDK is a python library for connecting to these nodes. It does not run its own node internally.
